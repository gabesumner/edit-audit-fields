# Edit Audit Fields

This project demonstrates how to edit audit fields in Salesforce.

Typically fields like CreatedDate are set automatically and cannot be modified. However, there is special audit setting and permission which enables these audit fields to be set during INSERT. This is useful for importing data into Salesforce.
